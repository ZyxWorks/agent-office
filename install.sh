# A dynamic profile does not inherit from the profile you actually use unless it
# is told to, so a themed office profile would otherwise hand you iTerm's stock
# keyboard map and lose Natural Text Editing's option-arrow word jump. Name the
# parent, which is the whole mechanism: iTerm resolves an unspecified attribute
# against that profile every time it loads this file.
#
# It used to ALSO copy the parent's "Keyboard Map" in here, and that is the bug
# this file is not allowed to have again. A dynamic profile is rewritten from
# its JSON on every load, so a copied map is frozen at install time AND
# uneditable afterwards: a binding you add in iTerm's own settings, or one a
# tool like `claude /terminal-setup` installs next month, never reaches the
# office profile and cannot be put there. Naming the parent and writing no map
# at all gets the inheritance the copy was imitating, live and for ever.
#
# The rule, for anything added here later: office may set what office is FOR
# (its look, and how scrolling behaves inside it). Nothing about your keyboard
# is office's to own.
#
# "Scrollback in Alternate Screen": false is in the JSON for one reason. iTerm
# defaults it to TRUE, which mixes an alt-screen app's lines into the window's
# own scrollback. tmux and every full-screen app inside it run on that screen,
# so a wheel-up that the app does not consume walks OUT of the office and into
# whatever the shell printed before tmux started — the login banner, the last
# `office off`. It reads as "my chat lost its history" and it is neither tmux's
# scrollback nor the app's, which is why no key inside the office can fix it.
