#
#   office on         walk in — open your office and start the day
#   office break      step out — detach; panes, sizes and agents all stay put
#   office off        go home — quit everything, and reset the layout to default
#
#   office <repo>     open a different repo (fuzzy name, e.g. `office myproj`)
#   office pick       fuzzy-pick from all your repos
#   office solo       like `on`, but start nothing but the tabs
#
#   office new [wt]   another session, in its OWN git worktree           (^Sn)
#   office task ...   another session, started on a task straight away
#   office desk       another session in THIS checkout, when you mean it
#   office chat       toggle the chat pane                           (^Sc)
#   office shell      toggle the shell pane                          (^Ss)
#   office edit       toggle the editor pane                         (^Se)
#   office hide/show  collapse the pane you are on / bring one back  (^Sx)
#   office layout     rebuild the two columns if they ever look wrong
#
#   office doctor     what's running and what it costs in RAM (read-only)
#   office clean      pick panes to close and reclaim their RAM
#   office sweep      close offices you walked away from, and all they run
#   office update     pull the newest agent-office (never happens on its own)

# so the arithmetic is ours. `left` is the desks, `right` is the glance strip;
# a three-row shell is as useless as a three-row agent.
# Where a pane of <kind> belongs: a target pane plus split-window/join-pane flags.
#
# Both columns can vanish. Park every session and the left column is
# gone; park the shell, editor and chat and the strip is. tmux collapses a
# two-column layout the moment one side empties, and from then on "leftmost
# pane" and "rightmost pane" are the same pane, so everything coming back lands
# in one tall stack. This is what stops that: when a column is missing, the
# first pane that needs it rebuilds it.
# Put the two columns back, from any mess at all.
#
# tmux layouts are trees, and only a window with ONE pane can be split into two
# root-level columns. Splitting a pane that already sits inside a stack nests
# instead, which is how a rebuilt column ends up half height. So the honest
# repair is to break every pane out, keep one, and re-join them in the order the
# office wants: sessions down the left, glance panes down the right.
#
# Only runs when a column has actually gone missing, because it makes every pane
# redraw. `office layout` is the same thing on demand.
# Is the window actually shaped like an office? Every session sharing one left
# edge, every glance pane sharing another, and the sessions on the left. Counting
# distinct columns is not enough: a nested split also produces two of them, and
# that is exactly the broken state this has to catch.

# screen says why. Set OFFICE_ON_ALWAYS=1 and the check no longer gates the
# start; it keeps answering the other two questions honestly.
#
# It is a separate switch and not `OFFICE_RUNNING_CHECK=false` on purpose. That
# check is a STATUS predicate, read in three places: this skip, the up/down line
# in `office status`, and `office off`, which runs OFFICE_OFF_CMD only when the
# check says something is up. Lie to it and going home silently stops stopping
# your stack — the Mac never sleeps, and the one word that was supposed to end
# the day is the one that quietly does not.
